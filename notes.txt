django-image-cropping

django-image-cropping-1.0.3.tar.gz is available online.
So we want this particular version

https://pypi.python.org/packages/0c/cb/bfaf5e56f7f2749bd9fa584186f88055733213dbab33ec23311a823d2d17/django-image-cropping-1.0.3.tar.gz#md5=9ec7ad22d804ec29146574f3d499a93b

That is the link
https://pypi.python.org/simple/django-image-cropping/
is the page where the link exists.

Inside the <a> tag, we get the text
django-image-cropping-1.0.3.tar.gz
which can definitely be formed programmatically.

Have running example_project directory, with "packages" subdirectory

curl -o example_project/packages/django-image-cropping/1.0.3.tar.gz https://pypi.python.org/packages/0c/cb/bfaf5e56f7f2749bd9fa584186f88055733213dbab33ec23311a823d2d17/django-image-cropping-1.0.3.tar.gz#md5=9ec7ad22d804ec29146574f3d499a93b

Make django-image-cropping/1.0.3 subdirectory, I suppose.

Tried to "python setup.py install", got error about easy_install

What is interface I want?
extract --name=django-image-cropping --version=1.0.3 --repo=example_project
Maybe with a "fromscratch" option

Should that get as far as setup.py, or not?

Ok, what do I want this notpip utility to consist of?
notpip getversions --package=easy_install?
